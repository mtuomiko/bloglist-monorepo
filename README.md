# Full Stack Open bloglist app

Part 11 Pokedex repository found at [full-stack-open-pokedex](https://github.com/mtuomiko/full-stack-open-pokedex).

Monorepository for [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course [exercise 11.21](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/expanding_further#exercises-11-20-11-22).

Application used to be hosted on Heroku free dynos under a generated app name morning-dusk-24998. Currently not hosted anywhere.

## Environment variables

The Node backend of the app uses three environment variables that need to be defined in `.env` file or some other way. The file `.env.example` contains the variable names.

`MONGODB_URI` which contains the URI for the MongoDB production database.
`TEST_MONGODB_URI` which contains the URI for the MongoDB test database.
`SECRET` which contains the secret used in signing the JSON Web Tokens generated by the backend.

## Usage

* `npm install` to install dependencies.
* `npm run start` starts the app in production. `express` serves the frontend content from `build/`
* `npm run start:test` starts the app in `test` environment which uses the test database (remember to build first)
* `npm run start:dev-client` starts only the React frontend in development mode with `webpack`
* `npm run start:dev-server` starts only the Express backend in development mode with `nodemon`
* `npm run build` builds using `webpack` into `build/`
* `npm run lint` run linting
* `npm run test` run tests on whole project
* `npm run test:client` run frontend tests
* `npm run test:server` run backend tests
* `npm run test:e2e` run `cypress` tests without GUI (assumes front- and backend are running in `test` environment)
* `npm run cypress` runs `cypress` with GUI using `cypress open` (assumes front- and backend are running in `test` environment)
